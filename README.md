[TEST] mithril ES6 JSX

`JSPM` is used to manage dependencies and load `ES6 modules`, as well as bundling the `js` in a single file.
The model is a `redux` store.
The view and the controller are managed by `mithril`.
The view is written in `JSX` and is converted to "tag" object for `mithril` to use (done by `babel-plugin-mjsx`).
The tests are written with `mocha`.
